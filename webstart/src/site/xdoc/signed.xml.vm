     <section name="Note on signed jars">
        <p>
        I'm still not sure how I want to handle signed jars.<br/>
        No user in their right mind would accept this dialog box.<br/>
        <img src="images/javasecuritywarning.png" /><br/>
        Personally, I <b>do not</b> sign my jars.
        I stay in the sandbox. I don't access files on the local computer and I don't access web sites that didn't originate at the
        application's site. <br/>
        If you need to access web content, just add a proxy to your web server to deliver these pages to your user's application.<br/>
        If you are worried about your applet getting hacked in-transit, just deliver it with https.<br/>
        Okay?
        </p>
        <p>
        If you must use a signed jar, you will need to disable compression, by setting the jnlp.packEnabled flag to false, or
        add an OSGi manifest and do a pack200 repack operation to make sure that your jar gets to the destination unchanged.<br/>
	Disable compression like this:<br/>
        <code>http://localhost:8181/webstart/docs/javafx.html?appletClass=ensemble.Ensemble2&amp;jnlp.packEnabled=false</code>
